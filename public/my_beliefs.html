            Energy generation from an early childhood has always fascinated me. Being born in 1994, my
childhood it always felt we were on the cusp of making the transition to more sustainable and
renewable energy sources. But here we are several decades later and while there has been
substantial progress, this wasnâ€™t the future my childhood self thought it was going to be. So this
is an important topic to me and to share with the public because we needed to have acted
sooner like I had envisioned when I was younger, but now is the second best time to further act
for the environment and we as people this might be our last time period to have an impact on
the situation.
