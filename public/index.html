      <p>
        There are many models which can describe sustainability, a common method is the three pillars
        of sustainability.<a href="/outreach-project/references.html">[1]</a> We can apply these models to how
        energy is generated and see how sustainable they are. Ideally sustainable energy generation can be viewed as a
        way to generate energy that does not take away from the environment, society, or the economy. Depending on what
        your views are, it is possible to have ideologies of sustainability that do not maintain all 3 pillars. This
        website will go on to explore different types of energy and additional information regarding energy and also
        pros and cons of the types of energy generation. e.g. Maybe it is cheaper to initially produce, or potentially
        it has a substantial environmental impact. I will later explore 3 additional sections as well. Such as pandemic
        impact, actions that could be taken, and my beliefs/opinion on moral obligations regarding energy sustainability.
